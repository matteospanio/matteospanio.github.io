      "summary": "The article presents a software application that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect irregularities on open-reel audio tapes during the digitization process, addressing the preservation challenges of aging analog audio documents. Developed at the Centro di Sonologia Computazionale (CSC) at the University of Padua, the software analyzes video recordings made during digitization to automatically identify potential tape damages, splices, and other anomalies. Using Generalized Hough Transform and SURF algorithms, it pinpoints regions of interest within the tape. This application, part of the MPAI/IEEE-CAE ARP standard, supports archivists and musicologists in preserving and analyzing open-reel audio archives."

      "summary": "The article introduces a novel method based on envelope derivatives, aimed at detecting reverse audio segments in analog audio preservation, particularly for open-reel tapes. This method is designed to integrate with the MPAI Context-based Audio Enhancement (CAE) Audio Recording Preservation (ARP) standard. By employing derivative-based signal processing algorithms, the system automatically identifies and corrects reverse-recorded audio sections, improving accuracy and efficiency in large-scale archiving. Tests on a diverse dataset of musical genres and digitized tapes show the method's effectiveness across various audio content types."
