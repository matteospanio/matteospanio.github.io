Hi there, I'm Matteo Spanio, Ph. D. student at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/). I'm interested in:

- ðŸ¤– machine learning,
- ðŸ“¡ signal processing,
- ðŸŽ¹ music.

My Ph. D. project focuses on studying deep learning methods for music generation based on cross modal perception.

I'm member of the [MPAI group](https://mpai.community), the international, unaffiliated, no-profit organisation developing standards for AI-based data coding.

I'm also a musician, and I play the clarinet on a regular basis in many orchestras and ensembles (Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto, Orchestra del Friuli Venezia Giulia, Orchestra San Marco, Concordia Chamber Orchestra, Rossini Ensemble and many others).

To see my work, check out my [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) and [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/). Time permitting, I also write [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/).
