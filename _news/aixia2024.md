My two new papers _Towards Emotionally Aware AI: Challenges and Opportunities in the Evolution of Multimodal Generative Models_ and _Filming the sound: Anomaly Detection on Audio Tape Recordings using Computer Vision Algorithms_ have been accepted for publication at the [23rd International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://aixia2024.events.unibz.it/) that will take place in Bozen between 25 and 28 november. See you there!
